For the topic of my choice, I picked Fenway Park. The day that the Red Sox announced they'd fired the general manager, I was able to visit and take pictures. One of the most striking features around the ballpark are the World Series banners that celebrate each of the wins. They are also a symbol of the pride that fans hold in the team. While walking down Jersey St, I spotted a fire hydrant that was dotted in stickers. It was right outside of the team store, and the stickers were the kind that would be taken off hats and sweatshirts after purchase. One of the indicators of how much fans are liking their team is merchandise sales. Recently, the Red Sox haven't been doing so well, which likely prompted the leadership change.

Afterwards, I visited Chinatown to take photos for Boston history. Chinatown is one of the cultural centers in Boston, and has its roots in the old garment district. When I looked for things that caught my eye, I was drawn to the murals and artwork splashed on the walls of many buildings. The banners and decorations across lampposts were also present on many streets.

This weekend happens to be the Mid-Autumn Festival, and there's always lots of events to celebrate. The atmosphere in Chinatown will be bustling with excitement, and there will be mooncake and strings of firecrackers aplenty. Also, lots more decorations.

This mural of hot pot was originally created for a restaurant, and since it was put up there have been several (unauthorized) additions, which I discovered by comparing my picture to a past picture of the mural I found online. I thought that the layering of artwork created was interesting, and how the original mural's foreground was not covered by tags even though it was clearly added to by rogue graffiti artists.
