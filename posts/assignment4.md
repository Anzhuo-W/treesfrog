Each year, the Northeastern University Pep Band gathers for one special event â€“ Megaband. Typically the band's presence at a home sporting event consists of around 37 members, or just over a third of all band members. It's dependent on instrumentation and people's personal schedules. Megaband is based around as many people in the band as possible playing at a game, including welcoming back alumni.

This semester, Megaband took place on November 10th. Northeastern's women's hockey team took on Providence in Matthews Arena for the first hockey game of Homecoming Weekend.
